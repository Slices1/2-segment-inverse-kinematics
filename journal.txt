To help learn SDL2 and it's line drawing, I am implementing my 2 segment IK arm from desmos.
I am controlling the origins position with the arrow keys, however it only goes down and left.
I added debug messages (1.jpg). 
Pressing up resulted an up and a down message.
Down resulted in a left, up & down message.
Left resulted in a left, up & down message.
Right resulted in a right, left, up & down message.
Noticing the pattern of number of inputs detected correlating with line number, I added breaks and it fixed it.
For this small project, I controversially used "O" as the variable name for the origin of the IK arm. Being a small project that I have already completed on desmos, I knew that this would'nt come back to bite me.


could be that its dividing by 0 in the arctan thingys
The floating point exceptions were.
I also added a delay as to not 100% my cpu so often.


Now, I am prototyping the mechanical arm.
Thoughts: it'll be symmetrical. just requires a base, and grabber.
The base's arms will be the same length, and parrallel when in either grabbing position
I have an idea to make single linkages instead and have the motors have higher torque, lower speed.
update: I simplified the mechanism a lot and will use an electromagnet to grab the box. I can implement proper collision detection & grabbing later.
